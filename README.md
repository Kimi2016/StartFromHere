Unity function order manager

This is a function manager for Unity function.By using this framework ,
all the function which is inherit from Monobehaviour can be order by yourself.

It is very easy to use,and all the atrribute can be defined by yourself ,so as the scripts's function.
You dont need to write void Start() or void Awake(),just add a attribute for the function,all the functions 
can execute in the same level.

Here is my blog you can check it : http://blog.csdn.net/cartzhang/article/details/52372611

Any question,pls let me know.

That is all ,thank you!

1. All the Attribute can be inherited by the same Attribute SFHCall.
2. Now u can decide all the scripts's execution order totallly.
3. You can define Attribute by yourself.

Now, add a list in same level has same number under the same attribute.
So ,there will be no error or collision if you has same number under same attribute.
And also,they all be excuted in same level ,but each of them can not get the execution time,because they are random.

Hope you enjoy it. have fun.
