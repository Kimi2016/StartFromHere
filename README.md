Unity function order manager

This is a function manager for Unity function.By using this framework ,
all the function which is inherit from Monobehaviour can be order by yourself.

It is very easy to use,and all the atrribute can be defined by yourself ,so as the scripts's function.
You dont need to write void Start() or void Awake(),just add a attribute for the function,all the functions 
can execute in the same level.


Any question,pls let me know.

That is all ,thank you!
